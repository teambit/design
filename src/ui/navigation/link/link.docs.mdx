import { Link } from './link';

A designed link, to be used all across the app. It is composed over `base-react`'s Link, with additional styles.
Like the original Link, it will receive the concrete implementation from context, and work everywhere. Read more about it [here](https://bit.dev/teambit/base-ui/routing/link).

### Component Usage

```tsx live
<>
  <Link href="https://bit.dev">Go to bit.dev</Link>
  <br />
  <a href="https://bit.dev">regular link</a>
</>
```
