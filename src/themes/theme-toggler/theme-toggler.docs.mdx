A theme switcher that toggles between a list of themes. It will immediately apply the selected theme.

The toggler comes with Light and Dark themes built in.

# Basic usage

```tsx
const themes = [LightTheme, DarkTheme, ChristmasTheme, HighContrast];

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeSwitcher themes={themes}>
      <ThemeToggler />
      {/* themed content */}
    </ThemeSwitcher>
  );
}
```
